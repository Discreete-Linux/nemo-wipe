* Adapt the default wipe algorithm and the manual to the latest papers
  suggestions (a few random passes are enought on modern hard drives).
  Use the secure-delete's `-l` option could be a good option.
  cf. http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html and
  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-88/NISTSP800-88_rev1.pdf

* Perhaps cleanup a bit progress dialog, it is currently overkill

* Add our entries in the same section on the context's menu that
  the "Delete" and the "Move to trash" entry
  -> I don't think it's possible
