* Better progress dialog, perhaps as a derivated widget allowing:
   * Setting the current progress status;
   * Setting the current status message;
   * Connecting a signal to watch a user cancel;

* Cleanup configure script
   * Check minimal dependencies (minimal versions of libraries)

* Add our entries in the same section on the context's menu that
  the "Delete" and the "Move to trash" entry

* Add an icon for sfill

* Sfill: display the mountpoints in the confirmation dialog. Requires
  to calculate them before displaying the message.
