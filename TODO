* Perhaps cleanup a bit progress dialog, it is currently overkill

* Cleanup configure script

* Add our entries in the same section on the context's menu that
  the "Delete" and the "Move to trash" entry
  -> I don't think it's possible

* Add an icon for sfill

* Sfill: display the mountpoints in the confirmation dialog. Requires
  to calculate them before displaying the message.
  * Add a "/" to show that pathes are absolute

* Use a thrash icon in the confirmation dialog
