# Short description

`nautilus-secure-delete` allow to wipe files or free disk space from
`nautilus`.

Usually when you delete a file, even when bypassing the trash, it's
not accessible anymore, but its content still exists on the media that
contained it until a new file is written over it. Consequently, it can
be quite easy to recover it.

`nautilus-secure-delete` enables you to wipe files and available disk space
from `nautilus` using the `secure-delete` program written by van Hauser /
THC[1].

# An introduction to data deletion


## Deleting doesn't affect data

When you delete a file, even when bypassing or emptying the trash, you only
tell your computer that you don't care anymore for the file. The file's
entry is removed from the list of existing files but the content of the file
remains on the storage medium. The data will remain there until the
operating system reuses the space for new data.

This could take weeks, months or years before this space is actually
used for new data, actually overwriting the content of the deleted
file. Until then, it's possible to recover it by reading directly the
data on the storage media. That's a quite simple operation, automated
by numerous softwares.


## An answer : overwriting data several times

If you want to make the content of a file really hard to recover, you
have to overwrite it with other data. But that's not enough. On a
magnetic hard disk, it's known[2] that the content can still be
recovered by doing magnetic analysis of the hard disk surface. To
address this issue, it's possible to overwrite several times the
content to be deleted. That process is called "wiping".

If some sensible files have been already deleted without paying
attention to this issue, some of their data probably remains on the
storage media. It's thus also useful to wipe all the available free
space of a storage media.

## Limitations

This section is quite technical. In a nutshell, there's a lot of limitations, so
using this tool without setting up a complete security policy will probably be
useless.

- Temporary files and disks: lots of programs writes temporary and backup files.
  This means that the sensitive data you want do delete probably exists in an
  other form somewhere on your computer;
- swap space: most operating systems could save data they are working on on a
  part of the hard disk called swap space. Your sensitive data could exist
  there;
- storage media features: modern storage mediums often reorganize their content,
  e.g.  to spread the writings over the media or to hide defective places to the
  operating system. Consequently, you can't be sure that the actual place
  occupied by your sensitive data was wiped;
- journalized file systems: modern file systems log modifications of the files
  to ease recovering after a crash. This could make wiping inefficient. The same
  kind of problem exists with redundant file systems (e.g. RAID), file systems
  that make snapshots or that caches data (e.g. NFS). However, only the names of
  the files are logged if you use the default parameters of the standard Linux
  file system (ext3/ext4);
- old algorithms: the wipe algorithms are old, and they are not guaranteed to
  work as expected on new storage medias.


## The wipe algorithm

nautilus-secure-delete enables you to wipe files and free disk space
from `nautilus` using the `secure-delete` program written by van Hauser
/ THC [3]

>     The deletion process is as follows:
>
>     1. The overwriting procedure (in the secure mode) does a 38 times
>        overwriting. After each pass, the disk cache is flushed.
>     2. truncating the file, so that an attacker don't know which
>        disk blocks belonged to the file.
>     3. renaming of the file, so that an attacker can't draw any conclusion
>        from the filename on the contents of the deleted file.
>     4. finally deleting the file (unlink).

# Using `nautilus-secure-delete`


## Launching nautilus-secure-delete


### Wiping file(s) or directory(es)

Select the file(s) you want to wipe, and right-click on them. If
`nautilus-secure-delete` is able to wipe them, there will be a "Wipe" entry in
the context menu.


### Wiping available diskspace on storage media

Select a file or a directory which is on the partition on which you want to wipe
the available diskspace. If `nautilus-secure-delete` is able to wipe it, there
will be a "Wipe available diskspace" entry in the context menu. 


## The confirmation dialog

Once you click a menu item, a confirmation dialog will appear, where you can
confirm or abort the wipe, and choose options (see next section).


## The progress dialog

If you confirm the wipe, a dialog will appear to let you see the progression of
the deletion. For big files or partitions with a lot of available diskspace,
wiping can take hours.

It's possible, but discouraged, to cancel the wipe process. This would kill the
underlaying `secure-delete` program and could lead to strange things like files
partially overwritten but not deleted or big junk files.

When the wipe is finished, a dialog should inform you of the success of the
deletion.


# Configuring `nautilus-secure-delete`

In the confirmation dialog, you can click on the arrow left to the "Options"
word to display options. To understand these options, you must have a good
overview of the wipe process. If it's not already the case, please read [[An
introduction to data deletion]].


## Number of passes

You can configure the number of times that the data to be wiped is overwritten
by new data.


38

: Overwriting the data 38 times should prevent data recovery through
  magnetic analysis of the hard drive surface. This is achieved by the
  following procedure:

  - 1x overwrite with 0xff
  - 5x random passes
  - 27x overwriting with special values to make the recovery from MFM and
    RLL encoded hard disks hard/impossible - see Gutmann's paper on that
    which is also included.
  - 5x random passes

  This is the default value.

2

: Only two passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode random
  values. [FIXME: implications]

1

: Only one random pass is written. Overwriting the data only one time should
  prevent from data recovery by analyzing raw data written on the storage
  media, but is useless against magnetic analysis of the hard drive surface.


## Fast and insecure mode (no /dev/urandom, no sync)

Fastens the wipe at the expense of security:

- use a more predictable but faster pseudo-random number generator;
- do not ensure that overwriting data is actually written on the storage media.


## Last pass with zeros instead of random data

Use zeros for the last overwrite, which is the data that will be actually easy
to read. The default is to use pseudo random data.
